## The Two Pillars: Relationship and Righteousness (Jan 11)

The Mark of God stands on two unshakable pillars: a real relationship with God and a life of obedience to His commands.

### Day 1

God's covenant promise spans generations—mercy to those who love Him and keep His commandments.

>"For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments." (Exodus 20:5-6)

The New Covenant promise—God's law written on hearts, and an intimate knowledge of Him.

>"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people." (Jeremiah 31:33)

 [Read Jeremiah 31](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JER.31.NKJV)

### Day 3

The terrifying words: "I never knew you"—religious activity without genuine relationship.

>"Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'" (Matthew 7:22-23)

### Day 6

The test of genuine faith: keeping His commandments proves we truly know Him.
