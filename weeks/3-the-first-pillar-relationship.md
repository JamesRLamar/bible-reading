### The First Pillar: Relationship

The First Pillar of the Mark of God is a genuine, intimate relationship with Him—knowing Him, not just knowing about Him.

### Day 1

Moses experienced the ultimate intimacy—speaking with God face to face as a friend.

>"So the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend." (Exodus 33:11)

### Day 2

God shares His secrets with those who fear Him and walk in covenant with Him.

>"The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him, and He will show them His covenant." (Psalm 25:14)

 [Read Psalm 25](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.25.NKJV)

### Day 3

A soul that thirsts for God—longing for His presence more than anything else.

>"O God, You are my God; early will I seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water." (Psalm 63:1)

 [Read Psalm 63](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.63.NKJV)

### Day 4

Abraham was called the friend of God—a title born from a life of faith and fellowship.

>"But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the descendants of Abraham My friend." (Isaiah 41:8)

 [Read Isaiah 41](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/ISA.41.NKJV)

### Day 5

Mary chose the better part—sitting at the feet of Jesus, prioritizing relationship over activity.

>"And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard His word." (Luke 10:39)

 [Read Luke 10](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/LUK.10.NKJV)

### Day 6

No longer servants but friends—Jesus invites us into intimate knowledge of the Father's heart.

>"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you." (John 15:15)

 [Read John 15](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.15.NKJV)

### Day 7

Eternal life defined—not a place, but a Person; to know the Father and the Son.

>"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent." (John 17:3)

 [Read John 17](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.17.NKJV)
