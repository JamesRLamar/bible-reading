## The Second Pillar: Righteousness

The Second Pillar of the Mark of God is the evidence of living faith—a life of obedience to His commands.

### Day 1

Abraham set the pattern: faith expressed through obedience to God's voice.

>"Because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws." (Genesis 26:5)

 [Read Genesis 26](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/GEN.26.NKJV)

### Day 2

God's heart cry for a people who would keep His commandments always.

>"Oh, that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!" (Deuteronomy 5:29)

 [Read Deuteronomy 5](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/DEU.5.NKJV)

### Day 3

David's legacy—a man who kept God's commandments and followed Him with all his heart.

>"But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes." (1 Kings 11:34)

 [Read 1 Kings 11](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/1KI.11.NKJV)

### Day 4

The blessed life: delighting in God's law and meditating on it day and night.

>"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and in His law he meditates day and night." (Psalm 1:1-2)

 [Read Psalm 1](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.1.NKJV)

### Day 5

Obedience is the proof of love—keeping His commandments is how we abide in Him.

>"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love." (John 15:10)

 [Read John 15](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.15.NKJV)

### Day 6

Faith without works is dead—be doers of the word, not hearers only.

>"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." (James 1:22)

 [Read James 1](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JAS.1.NKJV)

### Day 7

The final blessing—those who keep His commandments have the right to the tree of life.

>"Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city." (Revelation 22:14)
