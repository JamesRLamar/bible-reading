### The Mark of God

Throughout Scripture, God marks His people with an invisible sign of His covenant belonging—from Passover blood to the seal of His Spirit.

### Day 1

The first mention of God's mark—Passover blood as a sign of redemption.

>"It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt." (Exodus 13:9)

### Day 2

The Sabbath established as an eternal sign between God and His people.

>"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed." (Exodus 31:17)

### Day 3

The Shema—binding God's words as signs on hand and forehead.

Rahab's scarlet cord—a token of God's covenant loving-kindness.

Those who grieve over sin receive God's protective mark.
