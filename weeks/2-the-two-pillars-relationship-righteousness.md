## The Two Pillars: Relationship and Righteousness

The Mark of God stands on two unshakable pillars: a real relationship with God and a life of obedience to His commands.

### Day 1

God's covenant promise spans generations—mercy to those who love Him and keep His commandments.

>"For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments." (Exodus 20:5-6)

 [Read Exodus 20](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/EXO.20.NKJV)

### Day 2

The New Covenant promise—God's law written on hearts, and an intimate knowledge of Him.

>"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people." (Jeremiah 31:33)

 [Read Jeremiah 31](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JER.31.NKJV)

### Day 3

The terrifying words: "I never knew you"—religious activity without genuine relationship.

>"Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'" (Matthew 7:22-23)

 [Read Matthew 7](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.7.NKJV)

### Day 4

The Two Pillars united in one verse: love and obedience inseparably linked.

>"If you love Me, keep My commandments." (John 14:15)

 [Read John 14](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.14.NKJV)

### Day 5

God's firm foundation stands: He knows those who are His, and they depart from iniquity.

>"Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are His,' and, 'Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.'" (2 Timothy 2:19)

 [Read 2 Timothy 2](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/2TI.2.NKJV)

### Day 6

The test of genuine faith: keeping His commandments proves we truly know Him.

>"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, 'I know Him,' and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." (1 John 2:3-4)

 [Read 1 John 2](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/1JN.2.NKJV)

### Day 7

The end-times remnant defined: those who keep God's commandments and hold the testimony of Jesus.

>"And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." (Revelation 12:17)
