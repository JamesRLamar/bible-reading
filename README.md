# bible-reading

## Goals for this plan
- Canonical coherence: Torah → Prophets → Writings → Gospels → Apostolic writings
- Messianic continuity: Yeshua is not imported late but emerges organically
- Liturgical sensitivity: Feasts, seasons, and rhythms are honored
- Balanced diet: Narrative, law, wisdom, prophecy, gospel, epistle
- Weekly theological arc rather than random daily readings

Remove the numbering and just allow the compile to add dates

### Day 2

>"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple" (Psalm 19:7)

 [Read Psalm 19](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.19.NKJV)

## ideas

 old testament echoes int he NT 
Fasting week after trumpets week
Passover week could include mirrors of psalm 22 and the crucifixian chapter
A week for every fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, self-control
A week on prophecy preceeding pentecost. Stories like Samuel being called, the seventy elders, Saul prophesying over David, the Anna? From the gospels, Simeon? Mary, Bezalel Filled with the Spirit

## **Strong Theme Candidates from Your Book**

  The Two Pillars
  
- **John 14:15** / **1 John 2:3-4** – Love and obedience as the Two Pillars

2 Timothy 2:19


Exodus 20:5-6: The covenant of the mark of God

Revelation 14:12, 12:17

### **1. The Mark of God: Signs of Covenant Belonging**

*Chapters 1-5 of your book*

  

This theme has excellent diversity across both testaments:

- **Exodus 13** – The first mention of God's Mark (Passover blood on doorposts)

- **Exodus 31:13-17** – Sabbath as a sign between God and His people

- **Deuteronomy 6:4-9** – The Shema (binding His words as signs on hand/forehead)

- **Ezekiel 9** – Those marked who "sigh and cry" over sin

## **Themes That Are Present But May Need Supplementation**

  

| Theme | Chapters | Notes |

|-------|----------|-------|

| **Lost Love / First Love** | Ch. 18 | Good content but may need more OT diversity |

| **Authority & Tradition** | Ch. 16 | Strong on church history, lighter on direct scripture |

| **Meditation & Intimacy** | Ch. 18 | Brief section; could pair with prayer theme |

| **The Two Churches** | Ch. 13 | More theological/historical than scripture-rich |

## **Suggested New Week Theme: "Signs of the Set-Apart Life"**

  

Based on your specific request for a week including *Mark of God, Sabbath, fasting, loving your neighbor*, here's a possible week:

  

| Day | Chapter | Theme |

|-----|---------|-------|

| Day 1 | Exodus 13 | The Mark of God born in blood (Passover) |

| Day 2 | Exodus 31:12-18 | Sabbath as God's sign |

| Day 3 | Deuteronomy 6:1-9 | The Shema: binding His words as a sign |

| Day 4 | Isaiah 58 | True fasting + Sabbath delight |

| Day 5 | Leviticus 19 | "Love your neighbor as yourself" |

| Day 6 | Matthew 6:1-21 | Prayer, fasting, treasure (Kingdom priorities) |

| Day 7 | Revelation 14:1-12 | The Mark of God vs. the Mark of the Beast |

  

This week would directly reflect your book's central thesis about the **Two Pillars** (love and obedience) and the visible signs that mark God's people.
